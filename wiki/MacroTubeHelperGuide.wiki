#labels Phase-Deploy,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

Here is a quick guide to get you going. Close Windows Media Center and all programs before running the installation package. To see user questions or ask a question please use the FAQ [https://groups.google.com/d/topic/macrotube-providers-discuss/5rfQVQGnmmM/discussion here]


= Details =

The MacroTube Provider Helper is intended to replace the numerous xml configuration files for each video provider in MacroTube, with a version that uses the helper application instead. The Beta will only provide {{{YouTube/YouTube}}} HD support, so any of the providers still working with the current xml files will be unaffected.

={{{YouTube vs YouTubeHD}}}=

You no longer need to have both as the Helper has merged these two functionally. So at first an attempt is made to get the HD version of the video - if available. The fall back is then to attempt to locate the MP4 format.

Some videos will still display the old *"Video cannot be display for technical reasons"*. This is usually where none of the formats are suitable for Windows Media Center. Unfortunately, there is no work around for this.
 
={{{MacroTube Configuration}}}=

By default MacroTube installs the configuration files here:

*{{{C:\ProgramData\Jasmio\MacroTube\Providers}}}*

There is an xml file and image per provider.

Note this folder is hidden by default on Windows 7 and you may have to enter the path in the Start menu Run window to find it.

=Which Installer=

An installer is provided for 32-bit and 64-bit machines. Make sure to install the correct one. If you install the wrong one it will not work. In this case, use Add or Remove Programs to uninstall the incorrect version and install the correct one.


={{{MacroTube Helper Configuration}}}=

 # Download the appropriate the installer from the [http://code.google.com/p/macrotube-providers/downloads/list Downloads] area of this project.
 # If you chose not to automatically replace the xml config files, you need to manually copy the youtube.xml file as follows:
 ## Open the helper folder *{{{C:\Program Files\iVentris\MacroTube Helper}}}* 
 ## Copy the *{{{YouTube.xml}}}* and *{{{YouTube.png}}}* files to the *{{{C:\ProgramData\Jasmio\MacroTube\Providers}}}* folder.

=No thanks, not for me=

If you decide that the helper app is not for you, you can simply  uninstall it.

The app will uninstall itself completely, but the archived xml files in the MacroTube installation folder will need to be copied back manually. There is a date stamped folder *{{{C:\ProgramData\Jasmio\MacroTube\Providers\Archive_yyyyMMdd}}}* which will contain the replaced files. Just copy them to the Providers folder.
