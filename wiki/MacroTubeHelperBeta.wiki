#summary MacroTube Helper Beta testing

= Introduction =

Beta testers to join this group [http://groups.google.com/group/macrotube-providers-discuss] 
and express an interest under the Beta Testers topic        [https://groups.google.com/d/topic/macrotube-providers-discuss/raadFU1hncU/discussion]. 

At least 10 users required, especially those who use the youtube and youtubehd providers a lot, the more the better.


= Details =

The basic idea is to provide a source xml file which uses a helper app to get the video URL. The Helper App will pass the video url to a web service which will do the necessary parsing and return the video url.

No having to download and update provider xml files - a pain if your WMC is under your TV without a mouse or keyboard. It will start off with youtube and youtubehd support. 

The trial will start on 20 August 2012 and run for 30 days, after which a license key will be needed.

= Roadmap =

The app will aim to incorporate all the existing MacroTube providers. There will be a one off license cost of $15. No additional cost if you have multiple WMC machines. Think of it as a Windows Media Center Appstore app. 

Existing providers and xml files will remain available and anyone can upload an xml file for any provider here. You do not have to pay for a license to use the community provided xml files.

Comments and thoughts welcomed.
